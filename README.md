The-first-Erlang-MySQL-driver
=============================
<hr/>
The first Erlang MySQL driver, in ~270 lines of code, seems to have been written between 2001 and 2004 by Magnus Ahltorp at the Swedish Royal Institute of Technology.

It exposes low level, blocking functions to talk 4.0 protocol with a MySQL server.

I just replaced one bif（concat_binary to list_to_binary）and format the code using my vim.

Besides, I drew a sequential chart to help read it.
